#This project covers a basic motion detection program that you can use on your computer or Raspberry Pi.

#It is based on Python.

#The program has capabilities such as detecting objects in the field of view, marking their timestamps, saving it to a .CSV file & also plotting a graph using Bokeh.

#This is my Fourth project. My next project will be about statistical data analysis in Python.

#I have my Tableau dashboard published on tableau public website. You can check that out here:
